### Nested Query

```sql
-- Find names of all employees who have sold over 50,000
-- IN = if there are multiples id.
SELECT employee.first_name, employee.last_name
FROM employee
WHERE employee.emp_id IN (SELECT works_with.emp_id
                          FROM works_with
                          WHERE works_with.total_sales > 50000);


-- Find all clients who are handles by the branch that Michael Scott manages
-- Assume you know Michael's ID
-- = if there is only 1 id.
SELECT client.client_id, client.client_name
FROM client

```

- Nested query with custom row-column.

```
-- Find the names of all clients who have spent more than 100,000 dollars
SELECT client.client_name
FROM client
WHERE client.client_id IN (
                          SELECT client_id

                          WHERE totals > 100000
);
```


- select infos from same table 
```sql
Employee table:
+----+-------+--------+-----------+
| id | name  | salary | managerId |
+----+-------+--------+-----------+
| 1  | Joe   | 70000  | 3         |
| 2  | Henry | 80000  | 4         |
| 3  | Sam   | 60000  | Null      |
| 4  | Max   | 90000  | Null      |
+----+-------+--------+-----------+

SELECT name AS Employee FROM employee AS empOne
WHERE salary > (
    SELECT salary FROM employee AS empTwo
    WHERE empTwo.id = empOne.managerId
